Module: TSL-2.0 Inventory Management- Stocks

Problem Statement: A vendor might run out of few of his supplies. To a
		  vendor, it’s a message that he has to order and for a
		  customer it’s a message of item unavailable.
		  Think of a design on how this can be achieved
		  where you have an inventory database. Design
		  appropriate front end pages where a vendor can
		  manage it. Handle the scenario with appropriate
		  error conditions that could occur.
